Businesses always want to find public or consumer opinions and emotions about their products and services. Potential customers also want to know the opinions and emotions of existing users before they use a service or purchase a product. Last but not least, researchers use these information to do an in-depth analysis of market trends and consumer opinions, which could potentially lead to a better prediction of the stock market. However, saying this, to find and monitor opinion sites on the Web and distill the information contained in them remains a formidable task because of the proliferation of diverse sites. Each site typically contains a huge volume of opinionated text that is not always easily deciphered in long forum postings and blogs. The average human reader will have difficulty identifying relevant sites and accurately summarizing the information and opinions contained in them. Besides, to instruct a computer to recognize sarcasm is indeed a complex and challenging task given that at the moment, computers still cannot think like human beings. Recent years have seen an increasing amount of research efforts expanded in understanding sentiment in textual resources. As we can see the statistics from web of knowledge in Figure one, the papers published on sentiment analysis have been increasing for the past years. One of the subtopics of this research is called sentiment analysis or opinion mining, which is, given a bunch of text, we can computationally study people’s opinions, appraisals, attitudes, and emotions toward entities, individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Applications of this technique are diverse. The objective of this paper is to classify the positive and negative reviews of the customers over different products and build a supervised learning model to polarize large amounts of reviews. Our dataset consists of amazon customers’ reviews and ratings, which we got from Consumer Reviews of Amazon products. We extracted the features of our dataset and built several supervised models based on that. We have implemented supervise learning algorithms such as naive bayes and linear supporting vector machines. We compared the accuracy of these models and got a better understanding of the polarized attitudes towards the products.
